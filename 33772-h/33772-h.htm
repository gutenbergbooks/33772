<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>There is a secure immortality and a depth of intuition
in the utterance of Wordsworth, the peer of
nature's poets, when from his pastoral reed he
strikes the notes:</p>

<p class="center">"The child is father of the man."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more insistently and persistently
true of the Indian child&mdash;the girl to be the
mother of warriors, the boy to become a hero and
the father of future "braves."</p>

<p>It goes back, all of it, to a heredity born of three
vital and vitalizing forces. The Indian holds with
steadfastness and devotion to his many and weird
ceremonies, but these all lead him back to the supreme,
piloting force of his life, his unfailing faith
in the Great Mystery.</p>

<p>The altar stairs to the spirit world are hills, buttressed
by granite; trees that talk with the winds&mdash;whispers
from the spirit world; the thunder of the
waterfall&mdash;the voice of the Great Mystery; stars&mdash;the
footprints of warriors treading the highways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of the Happy Hunting Ground. In all of these he
sees God.</p>

<p>Falling into communion with this happy philosophy
of life, the glory of Indian motherhood crosses
our path&mdash;and there are few things more beautiful.
When the day of expectation dawns upon her, she
seeks the solitude of all the majesty in which from
childhood she has seen the footprints of God&mdash;revels,
communes, rehearses to herself the heroism of the
greatest hero of her tribe, and all that the impress
of it may be felt upon the master man, the miracle
of whose life has been entrusted to her to work out.</p>

<p>For the first two full years of his life, a spiritual
hand guides his steps. There, in struggle and patience
and self-denial, he must learn all of nature's
glad story.</p>

<p>His grandparents then take him into their
school. He learns to ride before he can walk; he is
taught the use of the bow and arrow, which means
hitting the mark, keenness of vision, a steady aim,
precision, so that when the crisis comes he is ready&mdash;an
ample reason for the brave, effective and self-reliant
conduct of the Indian soldier on the fields of
France in the World War.</p>

<p>Deep breathing in the open air, giving full lung
power; self-denial, giving strength of limb and en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>durance
in the race; fellowship with all of nature's
winsome and wild moods; a discerning will power;
a steadfast reliance upon the guiding hand of the
Great Spirit, empower the Indian boy to stand on
all the high hills of history and challenge any militant
force that may confront him.</p>

<p>The sphere is complete; Boy: Mother: God.</p>

<h3>WILD GEESE</h3>


<p>Slow Dog, Medicine Man, looked out of
his lodge. Wild geese were honking
overhead. To the Indian it meant the return
of spring.</p>

<p>"I must be the first to kill one," muttered
Slow Dog. Entering his lodge, he presently
came out with bow and arrows. Hastening
toward a bend in the river which formed a
sheltered cove, he hid among a clump of willow
bushes and waited in the hope that the
birds might come down to feed.</p>

<p>Slow Dog was not the only one to notice
the geese, however. Two boys, one about fifteen
years of age, the other, close to thirteen,
had also heard the honking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get your bow and arrows," cried Hawk
Eye, the elder, darting into his tepee. The
younger boy, Raven Wing, ran to his lodge
for his weapons. In a few minutes both were
hurrying to the river.</p>

<p>"There's Slow Dog hiding in the bushes,"
whispered Raven Wing. "He wishes to be
the first to bring one to earth."</p>

<p>"Leave him there," answered Hawk Eye,
noticing that the flock, headed by an old gander,
had slightly altered its course. "The
geese are making for the lake." Breaking
into a run, the boys headed for Big Stone
Lake, from whose southern boundary issued
the "sky-tinted waters" of the Minnesota
River.</p>

<p>As they hurried through the timber belt
that bordered the river's edge, Raven Wing
remarked, "they may come down in the
marsh."</p>

<p>Ice still lay thick upon the lake, but on the
shallower waters it had begun to melt under
the increasing warmth of the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can they see us?" asked Hawk Eye as
Raven Wing, who was in the lead, stopped at
the further end of the grove.</p>

<p>"No. We have yet time to run across this
open space," answered the younger boy.</p>

<p>On reaching a thicket of willows, the boys
halted; then crept in to almost the edge of a
frozen stretch of swamp.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" whispered Raven
Wing. As the flock settled on the marshland,
Hawk Eye fitted an arrow to his bow. "I'll
take the one close to the leader," he said. Almost
simultaneously Raven Wing let fly his
arrow. The feathered ash wood shafts sped
to their marks and two birds fluttered and
fell to earth. Alarmed at the fall of their
comrades, the flock rose in the air, but before
they could get beyond arrow range, two more
birds dropped to earth.</p>

<p>"We've outwitted Slow Dog," chuckled
Hawk Eye, as he made his way over the half-frozen
ground to pick up his birds.</p>

<p>"He must return empty-handed," laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Raven Wing, retrieving his arrows from the
birds he had slain. "What do you intend to
do with your first kill?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Give it to Old Smoky Wolf," answered
Hawk Eye. "The goose first slain in the
Spring is always made the occasion for a
feast."</p>

<p>"I will give mine to my stepfather, Black
Eagle," said Raven Wing. "He will be our
chief when Old Smoky Wolf takes the trail of
departed warriors."</p>

<p>"Because you have outwitted him, Slow
Dog will now bear another grudge against
you," went on Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it were better had I not seen the
geese," sighed Raven Wing. "I would not be
the cause for further trouble between him
and my stepfather."</p>

<p>"Slow Dog would find one if it suited his
fancy," said Hawk Eye. "He has a tongue
with two ends, like a serpent's. But he has no
need to look for an excuse. He has not forgotten
that it was you who discovered the
buffalo herd during the great blizzard and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
saved us all from starvation. Had you not
done so, he would have succeeded in convincing
many that the famine had been sent by
the gods to punish us all for allowing your
mother to hunt with the men. You, he hates.
But for you, he might have persuaded the
tribe to elect him chief in place of Old Smoky
Wolf."</p>

<p>"He hates Black Eagle," said Raven
Wing, sadly.</p>

<p>"Because he knows our warriors will
choose Black Eagle to succeed Old Smoky
Wolf," added Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>As the boys neared camp, Slow Dog came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
out of the bushes by the river bank. A scowl
spread over his face on seeing the dead geese.
"He is a great hunter when the birds fly down
to be killed," he sneered.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus014.png" alt="" width="600" height="311" /><br />
    <span class="caption">SLOW DOG CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES BY THE RIVER BANK.</span>
</div>

<p>"Had they not changed their course, your
arrow would have slain one," answered
Raven Wing, quietly.</p>

<p>Slow Dog turned on his heel and walked
to his tepee. The two boys continued on their
way. Presently they halted beside Old
Smoky Wolf's lodge. At the sound of approaching
footsteps, the aged chief had bade
his wife go out to greet whoever the visitors
might be.</p>

<p>Hawk Eye handed her one of the birds he
had slain. "'Tis the first goose brought to
earth. Hawk Eye would present it to our
chief," explained the boy. As he and Raven
Wing were about to turn away, Old Smoky
Wolf appeared in the doorway of the lodge.
He gravely thanked Hawk Eye on learning
of the gift.</p>

<p>"You both shall come to the feast," he
added kindly. The boys thanked him and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they turned away, a smile spread over Old
Smoky Wolf's wrinkled face.</p>

<p>"My tribe are not women. A brave is no
stranger in my village. These boys will become
great hunters. At the sound of their
moccasins the beaver will lie down to be
killed," grunted the old chief.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PLANS AND PELTS</h3>


<p>The sun grew warmer. The snow melted
and trickled in little rivulets down to the
river. Crocuses bloomed and red-winged
blackbirds cried amid the yellowing willows
in the bottoms. At last the ice broke in the
river and the waters rushed madly along between
its banks.</p>

<p>The hunters, who had been industrious
all winter, gathered together the pelts of the
animals they had killed. Buffalo robes and
deer skins, together with pelts of minks, martins,
foxes, wolves, beavers, bears, fishers,
otters and raccoons. Thousands of muskrat
skins were also made up into bundles.</p>

<p>The packs were loaded into canoes and
the hunters set off down stream for the trading
post at Mendota.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Raven Wing and Hawk Eye watched the
canoes for some time. When the last frail
craft had turned the bend in the river, Raven
Wing said to Hawk Eye, "Let us make the
trip also, and take our pelts to the trading
post."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus020.png" alt="" width="443" height="600" /><br />
    <span class="caption">RAVEN WING AND HAWK EYE WATCHED THE CANOES FOR SOME TIME.</span>
</div>

<p>"Will your stepfather allow you to go on
so long a trip?" asked Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"I can but ask him," answered Raven
Wing.</p>

<p>"We will go, you and I, if he agrees," said
Hawk Eye. "I have no father to ask permission
of. Besides, I am two years older than
you. My mother I know will give her consent."</p>

<p>Presently both boys were on their way to
their lodges. Bending Willow, Raven
Wing's mother, looked up as her son stood
before her.</p>

<p>"I would like to take the pelts I have cured
from my winter's hunting to the trading post.
Hawk Eye plans to go also and we can make
the journey together," he announced in a low
voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Bending Willow regarded the tall, strong
boy for several minutes before she answered
him.</p>

<p>"I have no objection, son," she answered
quietly. "But you must receive permission
from your stepfather."</p>

<p>"Will you speak a good word for me?"
said Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"I will, my son," answered Bending Willow.
"I know that you will be careful. You
are strong and tall for your years. You are
a fine hunter; you know the river; your canoe
is well made."</p>

<p>As she finished speaking, Black Eagle
strode up.</p>

<p>"The hunters are well on their way," he
said. "The last canoe is now out of sight."</p>

<p>"Raven Wing wishes to take his pelts to
the trading post," announced Bending Willow.</p>

<p>Black Eagle turned to his stepson. "You
wish to go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy. "Hawk Eye will
go with me. He has many fine skins, also."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have had no experience as a
trader," said Black Eagle. "The pale faces
at the post will offer you foolish trinkets for
your good pelts. They may even make you
dull and foolish with their minne wauken,
(firewater) and when your eyes are heavy-lidded
and your mind falters, strip you of
your pack."</p>

<p>"I will learn by watching our hunters
when they offer their pelts," answered Raven
Wing. "I will not be deceived by trinkets,
nor will I taste the firewater."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why he should not go,"
said Black Eagle after a silence of several
minutes. "How does his mother look upon
this adventure?" he added, turning to Bending
Willow.</p>

<p>"He must go some time. I am willing,"
she answered simply.</p>

<p>"Hawk Eye goes with you?" asked Black
Eagle.</p>

<p>"He is now asking permission of his
mother," replied Raven Wing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus022.png" alt="Bending Willow." width="297" height="300" />
</div>

<p>"When do you plan to go?" inquired
Bending Willow.</p>

<p>"At once," said Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"That is wise," said Black Eagle. "The
boys will easily catch up to the hunters if
they ply their paddles with vigor." He did
not add that there was safety in numbers, not
wishing to needlessly alarm Bending Willow.
He could see that she was concerned over the
adventure, although she tried to hide her
feelings.</p>

<p>The matter being settled, Raven Wing
strode over to Hawk Eye's lodge. Since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
death of Running Deer, Hawk Eye had taken
his father's place with credit. Being two
years older than Raven Wing, he naturally
had had more experience. Notwithstanding
his advantage, in age he was no taller nor
stronger than the younger boy.</p>

<p>As Raven Wing neared the tepee, he
heard Hawk Eye's mother, Light Between
Clouds, say in a low voice;</p>

<p>"You are my only support since the death
of Running Deer."</p>

<p>"Sure, Mother," answered Hawk Eye,
"but you would not have me always remain in
our village. Hawk Eye is now a man; he has
a mother in his wigwam, but he need not ask
her permission to go on the hunt."</p>

<p>"'Tis a long journey to the trading post,"
answered Light Between Clouds. "You have
had no experience at bargaining with the
palefaces. Why not wait and go with the
next band of trappers? There will be another
party setting out soon."</p>

<p>"They will merely trade in my pelts with
their own and I shall have nothing to say,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
cried Hawk Eye. "Besides, I would like to
gain experience first-hand. I am strong. I
can handle my father's gun with the best of
the hunters. I am a boy no longer. Comes
another snow and I shall be a warrior."</p>

<h3>LOADING THE CANOES</h3>


<p><ins class="correction" title="Original: Missing starting &quot;">"You</ins> are my only son," sighed Light Between
Clouds, gazing lovingly upon the
stalwart form of Hawk Eye. "You are the
main support of your sister and me. I am
loath to give my consent. It is a long journey
to the trading post at Mendota."</p>

<p>"Black Eagle, my stepfather, is willing
that I should go," broke in Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"And what does Bending Willow say?"
inquired Light Between Clouds.</p>

<p>"She agrees with my stepfather," answered
Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"Then you have my permission to go,"
said Light Between Clouds, turning to Hawk
Eye. "And may the Great Spirit look kindly
upon your adventure." Without further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
words, she turned on her heel and walked toward
a nearby lodge.</p>

<p>"So your mother is willing that you should
go," said Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"Yes, she has given her consent, as you
have heard," answered Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Why did she leave us so suddenly?"
asked Raven Wing, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"She has gone for moccasins, I think,"
replied Hawk Eye. "My grandmother is
skilful at making them; she always keeps a
supply on hand."</p>

<p>"You have more pelts than I have," remarked
Raven Wing, lingering a moment to
watch Hawk Eye deftly pack the skins in
several bundles of convenient size.</p>

<p>"We will need two canoes; yours and
mine," said Hawk Eye. "But should one be
damaged during the trip, we can get along
with one. We must lose no time in starting."</p>

<p>"I will be ready as soon as you are," answered
Raven Wing. He returned to his
lodge, gathered together his pelts, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
were already packed in several bundles, and
carried them down to the river. Hawk Eye,
having more experience, attended to the
loading of the frail vessels.</p>

<p>During the loading and packing, Ohitika,
Hawk Eye's favorite dog, watched the proceedings
in silence. Except for an occasional
wag of his tail, he stood still, showing no impatience.</p>

<p>"I would like to take Ohitika," said Hawk
Eye. "He is my favorite dog, my friend.
My father found him in a deserted Chippeway
village five years ago. He was but a
puppy then, his mother and the rest of the
litter had been killed by wolves, and father
discovered him lying in an old woodchuck
hole. Father bundled him in his blanket and
brought him home to me. I named him Ohitika
because he was so brave even as a pup.
At first he was my playmate, but he has become
my hunting companion. I hate to leave
him behind. But to make room for him it will
be necessary to place one of my packs in your
canoe."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus028.png" alt="Bow and arrows." width="261" height="300" />
</div>

<p>"That can easily be done," answered
Raven Wing. "I have fewer packs than
you."</p>

<p>"I shall take my father's gun, also," went
on Hawk Eye, as he transferred a bundle of
pelts to Raven Wing's canoe. "I am glad
that I have learned to use it. It is a fine gun,
as Running Deer, my father, often said. He
was not given to boast of his prowess as a
hunter, but always claimed it was due to his
gun that he rarely missed the mark."</p>

<p>"I must have a gun," cried Raven Wing.
"A fine gun, like yours. Do you think my
stock of pelts will bring me one?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you are clever at trading," answered
Hawk Eye with a chuckle. "And if not," he
added kindly, "you shall have some of mine to
fill in."</p>

<p>When the last pack had been carefully
loaded, Hawk Eye looked critically at his
work. "You have displayed much skill," observed
Black Eagle, who came up at that
moment.</p>

<p>"I took pains to watch the hunters load
their craft at sunup," said Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Safe carriage depends on good loading
as well as skill with the paddles," said Black
Eagle. "Be sure you re-load as well after
making portage below Lac Qui Parle. You
will come to a succession of rapids after leaving
the lake behind you."</p>

<p>Black Eagle might have said more had
not Bending Willow at that point arrived
with a bundle.</p>

<p>"I have brought you maple sugar," she
explained, handing the package to Raven
Wing. "'Tis some that I had on hand from
the sugar camp."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

    <a href="images/illus030_full.png"><img src="images/illus030.png" alt="Map of Minnesota." width="600" height="395" /></a>
</div>

<p>As she finished speaking, Light Between
Clouds came running toward them.</p>

<p>"These dried buffalo tongues will come in
handy should you not find plenty of game,"
she cried, giving the bundle to Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Sensing that the departure was at hand,
Ohitika waited no longer, but leaped lightly
into his master's craft. Stepping into their
canoes, the boys raised their paddles, then
dipped them into the water and made for the
middle of the river.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>JEALOUS SLOW DOG</h3>


<p>From his tepee Slow Dog gloomily
watched the departure of Raven Wing
and Hawk Eye, and his roving eye fell on the
graceful figure of Bending Willow, who was
waving a brave farewell to her only son, now
fast becoming a young brave.</p>

<p>Bending Willow was the daughter of a
haughty chief of the Spirit Lake and Leaf
Dweller Sioux, and was considered the most
beautiful woman in the tribe. When widowed
at the age of twenty, she had bravely
assumed the care and bringing up of her son.</p>

<p>Slow Dog had early realized that if he
married her his influence in the tribe would
be greatly increased, and resenting her preference
to cherish in widowhood the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of her husband, had been a persistent although
an unsuccessful suitor.</p>

<p>The day had come, however, when Slow
Dog's tepee grew lonely, and many hours had
been spent near that of Taopee, whose fat
daughter did beadwork while Slow Dog
played on a reed flute. In due course of time
a pony, two guns and some blankets had secured
the bride, who, veiled with a blanket
was taken to her lover's lodge and left there
by a friend.</p>

<p>From then on Slow Dog was busy with
practical things, for the father-in-law's
family must be provided with game for a
year, or until a little papoose should swing
from a lodge pole. Notwithstanding that
his lodge was no longer lonely, the heart of
Slow Dog still yearned for the beautiful
Bending Willow.</p>

<p>In the early part of the previous autumn
Bending Willow had returned from the wild
rice fields where she and the women of the
tribe had reaped a goodly harvest. Assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by a young squaw named Wadutah, she had
pitched her tepee in one of the villages of the
Sisseton Sioux along the southern shore of
Big Stone Lake.</p>

<p>Black Eagle, a great warrior and a wise
counsellor, was generally regarded as the
successor to Old Smoky Wolf when the aged
chief should take the trail of departed warriors.
Out of deference to the memory of his
friend, Lone Star, Black Eagle had long refrained
from approaching Bending Willow,
whom he had always admired. But just before
the winter season had set in, he had
pressed his suit and Bending Willow had consented
to become his wife, for she, too, had
often marked the prowess and wisdom of her
husband's companion. A marriage feast had
been celebrated and she had entered Black
Eagle's lodge.</p>

<p>Slow Dog had long coveted the leadership
of the tribe. He had plotted secretly to overthrow
the rule of Old Smoky Wolf, but his efforts
had been in vain. Black Eagle's
popularity had been greatly increased by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
marriage, which only added to the jealousy
of Slow Dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus034.png" alt="Canoe on the river." width="600" height="180" />
</div>

<p>"With Bending Willow in his lodge, Black
Eagle will prove a worthy successor to Old
Smoky Wolf," Slow Dog had often heard old
squaws remark, nodding their gray heads
over their beadwork.</p>

<p>Slow Dog had not joined the braves,
women and children who had gathered at the
river bank to speed the departure of the boys.
His long-nursed jealousy kept him away from
the crowd of well-wishers. But his keen eyes
noted as Hawk Eye and Raven Wing rounded
a bend in the river and were lost to sight,
that Black Eagle had stepped into his canoe
and paddled northward.</p>

<p>Was Black Eagle merely going to fish in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Big Stone Lake, from whose southern boundary
flowed the Minnesota River, he wondered,
or was he bound for the Red River of
the North, which flowed from the upper end
of the lake to Hudson Bay?</p>

<p>Presently Bending Willow returned to her
tepee which stood on a point of high ground
overlooking the river. From his lodge Slow
Dog could see her slender form as she busied
herself preparing food. Wild thoughts filled
his mind. Some dark night it might be possible
to seize her, place her in his canoe and
glide down the river. He pictured her in the
frail craft as he swiftly paddled downstream,
past the tepees of the Warpeton Sioux. He
knew every twist and turn of the river. At
Mankate, meaning "Blue Earth" in his language,
it turned sharply to the north and
east. Bending Willow should see Mendota,
"the meeting of the waters," for there the
beautiful Minnesota completed its long journey
of four hundred miles and mingled its
"sky-tinted waters" with those of the Mich-e-see-be,
"Father of Running Waters."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Not there, however, would he beach his
canoe. He would go further; past the high
white cliffs along the shore to Kaposia, and
down the Mich-e-see-be, upon whose western
bank dwelt the Medawakantens. Then up
the Canon River to its head waters where
stood the villages of the Wahpekutes, the
fourth tribe of the Minnesota Sioux. There
he would dwell with Bending Willow, the
Fawn of the Dakotas, the most beautiful
woman of the Sioux nation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>HAWK EYE'S OFFERING</h3>


<p>Hawk Eye and Raven Wing pointed
their canoes to the middle of the river
and bent to their paddles. In spite of its
many twists and turns and the menace of
fallen trees floating in the channel, they
made good progress.</p>

<p>The river ran through a narrow valley,
with hillsides covered with white flowers and
bottom lands dotted with yellow cowslips.
Birds, busy with their nesting, winged their
way through the balmy air. Willows, cottonwoods,
elms and soft maples made a leafy
border along the shore.</p>

<p>Toward late afternoon they came to a
widening of the river.</p>

<p>"Lac Qui Parle," Hawk Eye called back,
slowing down that Raven Wing might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
alongside. "I have heard my father say that
in the paleface tongue. It means the <ins class="correction" title="Original: &quot;lake that speaks.&quot;">'lake
that speaks.'"</ins></p>

<p>"Black Eagle once told me that the Mich-e-see-be
has a great widening which is called
Lake Pepin by the white man. It is bordered
by high bluffs and cliffs so steep that
very few cedars can take root," answered
Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"I have heard my father tell that only low
hills guard the Minnesota until its fringe of
trees thickens and it enters the big woods.
The hills change to bluffs that creep closer to
the water. At the mouth of the Blue Earth
River there is but a narrow strip of sand.
From there on the Minnesota makes a bend
upward toward the land of snow and the rising
sun," said Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"It is a long river," said Raven Wing.
"We shall have dipped our paddles many,
many times before we come to the trading
post."</p>

<p>"Have you fully decided to exchange your
pelts for a gun?" inquired Hawk Eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," answered Raven Wing quickly.
"I would like one like yours."</p>

<p>"It is a fine weapon, as I have often told
you," Hawk Eye said. "My father was proud
of it. He kept our lodge well supplied with
meat before an Objibway's bullet ended his
life."</p>

<p>"Let us make camp," Raven Wing suggested
after a time. "I see a sandy beach.
Up to now the shore has been bordered with
great flat rocks."</p>

<p>"It is too early," Hawk Eye said. "The
weather is fine. It is better to keep to our
paddles until sundown. Take care that your
canoe does not grate upon a hidden rock.
There are many in the water."</p>

<p>Raven Wing was glad when his elder
companion later turned toward shore for he
was becoming a little tired. It required skill
as well as strength to paddle the heavy laden
canoes.</p>

<p>"My father's grandmother was a Wahpeton
Sioux. Her tribe, called the People of
the Leaves, used to build their movable te<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>pees
along the shores of this lake," said
Raven Wing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus040.png" alt="Sioux brave." width="600" height="378" />
</div>

<p>"That was many, many years ago. We
shall have to sleep beneath a tree," answered
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"My grandfather made his first offering
to the Great Spirit here," went on Raven
Wing. "He tossed his most beloved possession,
a necklace of bear claws, into this very
lake."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful spot for such a ceremony,"
Hawk Eye said, thoughtfully. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
have not as yet made my offering to the Great
Spirit."</p>

<p>Raven Wing made no answer. After his
father's death his mother had arranged the
ceremony for him. He now wished that she
had chosen for that occasion the spot on
which his grandfather had stood.</p>

<p>As the canoes scraped bottom, Hawk Eye
said; "I will here offer my most valued possession
to the Great Spirit." Stepping on
shore, he opened a doeskin pouch that was
fastened to his belt.</p>

<p>"Your necklace of panther claws!" exclaimed
Raven Wing as Hawk Eye drew forth
his prize trophy.</p>

<p>"Yes," Hawk Eye answered, quietly. For
a moment he held it in his open palm for a
last look. Close by rose a great boulder of
granite. Clenching his fist about his most
beloved possession, he climbed to the top of
the rock and stood facing the lake for some
little time. Then, holding the necklace in his
right hand, he cried;</p>

<p>"O Great Spirit, I implore you to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>mand
the Sun, Moon and Stars to make my
path smooth that I may reach the brow of the
first hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus042.png" alt="" width="600" height="537" /><br />
    <span class="caption">HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE ROCK AND STOOD FACING THE LAKE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME.</span>
</div>

<p>"O Great Spirit, I implore you to command
the Winds, Clouds, Rain and Snow to make
smooth my path that I may reach the brow
of the second hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Great Spirit, I implore you to command
the Hills, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, Trees and
Grasses to make smooth my path that I may
reach the brow of the third hill.</p>

<p>"O Great Spirit, I implore you to command
the Birds, Animals and Insects to make
smooth my path that I may reach the brow of
the fourth hill.</p>

<p>"O Great Spirit, make me strong in heart
and limb to reach the brow of the fifth hill,
upon whose summit are the Happy Hunting
Grounds.</p>

<p>"O Great Spirit, receive my most precious
offering," and he flung the necklace far out
into the lake.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE BEAR</h3>


<p>On awakening the next morning
after a restful night, Hawk Eye said:</p>

<p>"Fresh meat tastes better than pemmican.
I will take my bow and arrows and see
what game I can find. In the meantime you
might gather some dry wood and start a
fire."</p>

<p>After a plunge in the cool waters of the
lake, he set out. For some distance he traveled
to the north, and on emerging from the
timber, he came upon a hillside covered with
low bushes. He had set an arrow against the
bowstring in readiness for whatever kind of
game might suddenly start up. As he looked
about, a rabbit darted across an open space.
But before it could reach cover, Hawk Eye's
arrow brought it tumbling to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enough for our morning meal," he observed.
After retrieving the arrow, he slung
the dead rabbit over his shoulder and started
on his way back to camp.</p>

<p>As there was no special trail leading toward
the water, he followed a course indicated
by several landmarks he had made note
of when first setting out. After crossing an
open space, he paused at the edge of the timber
belt that lined the banks of the river. He
thought he had heard a slight noise in the
underbrush. As the sound was not repeated,
he strode in among the trees, setting an arrow
against the bowstring. Presently he
heard a pounding noise followed by a wheeze,
and as he peered among the tree trunks, he
made out the form of a huge black bear.</p>

<p>Surprised for a moment, the bear halted;
then with a grunt took a step forward. Unprepared
for such big game, Hawk Eye
dropped into a backward walk, keeping his
eyes fixed upon the animal, which now quickened
its steps. Raising his bow and continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ing
to step backwards, he aimed an arrow at
the heart of the bear and let fly. With a cry
of pain and rage it tore the barbed shaft from
its bleeding side and rushed at him. Before
he could fit another arrow to the string, his
heel caught on a projecting root and he found
himself sprawling upon the ground. Springing
to his feet, he attempted to recover his
bow which had dropped from his hand, but
before he could pick it up, the infuriated animal
was almost upon him. Avoiding its outstretched
paws, he ran toward the river.</p>

<p>As he went crashing through the tangled
underbrush, he felt for his hunting knife.
Although somewhat relieved at finding it still
in his belt, he knew that his strength and skill
would be unequal to the task of slaying the
ferocious animal. His principal hope lay in
reaching the spot where Raven Wing had
kindled the fire for their morning meal.
Once there ahead of the bear he could rely on
Raven Wing and the loaded gun he had left
with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon, however, this hope disappeared.
The bear was gaining on him. Due to its
great weight it easily crashed through the
thick underbrush and tangled vines that impeded
his own progress.</p>

<p>Closer came the great lumbering animal
and he could almost feel its hot breath upon
his neck as he fought his way through a dense
thicket toward the river.</p>

<p>Continuing on as best he could he came to
an open space, covered with wide flat rocks.
A short distance ahead rose a giant boulder.
Scattered about its base lay a number of big
rocks. Leaping upon one of them, he managed
to jump to a narrow ledge upon the almost
perpendicular side of the great boulder.
From there he worked his way up to its flat-topped
surface by clinging to crevices and
projecting pieces of granite.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE KILL</h3>


<p>The bear had made straight for the big
boulder. Discovering that even by
standing on its hind feet it could not reach
the ledge upon which Hawk Eye had leaped
from the nearby rock, it came down on all
fours and began to circle the base of the
boulder. On coming to a point where the
base extended for some considerable distance,
it managed to climb up the steep incline
by means of its strong claws. At a point
further up, however, the flat surface of the
summit projected like the rim of a hat and
forced the panting animal to merely cling to
its position. At length it managed to get one
front paw over the edge. At once Hawk Eye
stabbed it with his knife. Roaring with pain,
it pulled it down. After a few minutes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
worked its way to one side where the rim was
less pronounced and getting a firm hold on a
shelf of rock with its hind feet, again
stretched over a front paw. Before Hawk
Eye could use his knife its other paw came
above the rim and its head appeared. Growling
and showing its teeth, it dug the claws of
its hind feet into the slanting rocky side and
raised itself.</p>

<p>Hawk Eye had only his knife. No loose
rocks lay upon the flat surface. Holding it
firmly in his fist he began to maneuver for a
fatal plunge at the animal's throat. But the
knowing beast kept its head in motion, making
it well nigh impossible for him to avoid
her gaping jaws. For several minutes he attempted
to plunge the sharp blade into its
throat. Suddenly the foothold it had managed
to maintain with its hind feet gave way,
and in order to avoid plunging down the side
of the great boulder, the bear desperately
pressed its chin upon the top of the rim to
keep from falling.</p>

<p>The animal's mouth now being closed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br /><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the pull-down of its body, and its head held
rigid by its weight, Hawk Eye seized the opportunity
he had been waiting for. Advancing
cautiously with knife in hand, he came
down on his knees and whipped the sharp
blade across the side of its throat.</p>

<p>The hold of its front paws weakened, its
head slipped off the ledge top, and its heavy
body hurtled to the ground. For a short time
the mortally wounded animal rolled about,
moaning and pawing the ground until, with
a final quiver, it lay still.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus050.png" alt="" width="445" height="600" /><br />
    <span class="caption">ITS HEAVY BODY HURTLED TO THE GROUND.</span>
</div>

<p>Hawk Eye climbed down the rock and
gazed silently at the huge body.</p>

<p>Then looking up into the sky, he murmured:
"O Great Mystery, my heart is glad
that you have aided me to gain a necklace of
bear claws. My spirit sings because you have
looked with favor upon the offering of my
most beloved possession."</p>

<p>Squatting down beside the bear's body,
he lifted one of the paws and carefully examined
the great claws before commencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to remove them one by one with his knife.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus052.png" alt="Campsite." width="300" height="213" />
</div>

<p>When all had been cut away, he placed
them in the doeskin pouch that hung at his
belt. He also slit the pelt down the belly and
cut a number of juicy steaks.</p>

<p>"I will return with Raven Wing for the
pelt," he thought, as he retraced his steps to
the spot where he had dropped his bow and
quiver of arrows. After some little distance
he came upon them and the body of the rabbit
which he had killed.</p>

<p>As he made his way back to the shore, he
noticed that the sun was high in the heavens.
Raven Wing by this time must be wondering
what had kept him away for so long a time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Quickening his steps into a run, he soon came
to their beached canoes. A fire which had
been kindled on the sand had burned down to
a heap of dead ashes. He looked about for
Raven Wing. He was nowhere in sight.</p>

<h3>THE PELT IS REMOVED</h3>


<p>Hawk Eye set the package of bear
meat in one of the canoes and again
looked about. Noticing that his gun had
been taken from the canoe in which he had
left it, he concluded that Raven Wing had
grown tired of waiting for him to return.</p>

<p>Not having tasted food since the previous
evening, he took out some pemmican and
commenced to eat. His appetite somewhat
satisfied, he stood up and again looked about
him.</p>

<p>"I may as well go back and skin the bear.
Raven Wing may not return for some little
time," he thought. The morning had already
slipped away and by the time the bear's pelt
could be removed he realized that the sun
would be low in the sky. So he set off without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
delay, stopping only at a tiny spring for a
cool drink.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus055.png" alt="Brave hunting." width="600" height="149" />
</div>

<p>On nearing the spot where he had first
encountered the bear, his ears caught the
sound of some one treading softly. As he
slipped behind a tree trunk and fitted an arrow
to his bowstring, he heard Raven Wing's
voice calling.</p>

<p>"Thought at first you might be the mate
of the bear I killed a while ago," cried Hawk
Eye, coming out into the open.</p>

<p>"What! You say you have slain a bear?"
exclaimed Raven Wing, dropping a couple of
prairie chickens which he had shot.</p>

<p>"Come, I will show you my kill," answered
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"I was following your trail from the hillside
when I caught sight of you at the edge
of the timber," explained Raven Wing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"From what I now see of the trail I should
judge you were being chased by the bear."</p>

<p>"I was," admitted Hawk Eye, with a grin.
"But it was no laughing matter at the time,
as you will soon see for yourself."</p>

<p>Presently they came to the rocky, flat
open space. As Raven Wing advanced and
caught sight of the animal's huge form lying
close to the base of the giant boulder, he uttered
a cry of amazement.</p>

<p>"What a bear!" he cried. "But look!
Someone has already removed the claws."</p>

<p>"They are safe in my doeskin pouch," answered
Hawk Eye. "I wished to make sure
of a necklace of bear claws before leaving the
body."</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit has rewarded you for
sacrificing the necklace of panther claws,"
said Raven Wing in an awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>"He has indeed," agreed Hawk Eye.
After a moment's silence Hawk Eye said,
"Help me remove the pelt."</p>

<p>Without further words both boys set to
work. It was no mean job they had under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>taken.
They found it necessary to cut down
two strong young saplings with which to turn
over the immense body. At length they were
able to tear the hide clear of the carcass.</p>

<p>As Raven Wing bound it up in a neat,
tight roll, he remarked, "I see you have already
taken the choice cuts."</p>

<p>"They are in my canoe," answered Hawk
Eye, wiping his blood-stained hands on the
bear's head.</p>

<p>"We have another pelt to trade," chuckled
Raven Wing, shouldering the package. "We
had better start at once for the river. The
sun is low."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Hawk Eye. "I do not
like the idea of leaving our canoes for so long
a time. Let us make haste."</p>

<h3>THE RAPIDS</h3>


<p>"Give me the pack," said Raven Wing,
after some little distance. Hawk Eye
placed it on the younger boy's shoulder and
took the gun which he had been carrying.
Examining it to satisfy himself that it was
loaded, he dropped the barrel into the curve
of his left arm. From the brow of the gentle
sloping hill they could see the river bordered
by trees through a narrow valley.</p>

<p>Great rocks of granite and limestone
cropped out everywhere upon the treeless
prairie and were turned a pinkish hue in the
glow of the setting sun. As the sun sank
lower in the west the boulders took on many
fanciful shapes.</p>

<p>"Not so long ago buffaloes roamed this
prairie," remarked Hawk Eye. "Now they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
graze further toward the land of the setting
sun."</p>

<p>"We will have plenty of fresh meat for our
evening meal," said Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"Yes, we have more than enough with the
prairie hens you shot and the bear meat,"
chuckled Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"You also killed a rabbit," added Raven
Wing.</p>

<p>On arriving at the beach where their
canoes lay, Hawk Eye unrolled the bear hide
and spread it very carefully from one bow to
another.</p>

<p>"At sunrise," he said, "I will scrape it
clean with my knife. I think it will dry in the
sun as we paddle and make a good pelt."</p>

<p>Raven Wing collected an armful of dry
wood and started a fire. Before long both
hungry boys were enjoying a hearty meal of
prairie hen and rabbit meat. After a drink
at the spring nearby, they spread their blankets
beneath a tree and went to sleep.</p>

<p>At sunup Hawk Eye set to work on the
bear pelt while Raven Wing re-kindled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
fire and prepared their morning meal. When
this was finished, he covered the smouldering
embers with fresh earth and followed Hawk
Eye to the beach. Pushing their canoes into
the water, they bent to the paddles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus060.png" alt="Brave by the campfire." width="600" height="161" />
</div>

<p>At this point the river was narrow.
Again fallen trees blocked the channel. At
times the boys found it necessary to push
them out of the way. Progress was slow, and
the sun was well up in the sky by the time
they passed the mouth of a small river called
The Last Stream With Trees.</p>

<p>"Fearless Bear told me the Minnesota
coils like a snake. He spoke the truth," remarked
Hawk Eye. "I have already counted
eight turns in less distance than the eye can
reach."</p>

<p>"The turns do not bother me," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Raven Wing. "But I have heard that there
are rapids further on. They may cause us
trouble."</p>

<p>"We will make a portage," said Hawk
Eye. "We cannot trust our pelts to the angry
waters."</p>

<p>"Then we must unload the canoes and
shoulder the packs," said Raven Wing.
"That will not be easy."</p>

<p>"It will be hard work," agreed Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Instead of going ashore for their midday
meal, the boys ate pemmican while paddling.
At sundown they ran the canoes ashore and
prepared to make camp for the night. After
a hearty meal of bear meat which had been
well-cooked the day before, they rolled themselves
in their blankets and lay down for the
night. For some little time they lay awake
listening to the night noises. But they were
weary with paddling, and in spite of the persistent
calls of the whippoorwills, they at
length fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Hawk Eye was the first to awaken. See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ing
Raven Wing still asleep, he quietly strode
down to the river for a bath. As Raven Wing
still slept on, Hawk Eye unpacked some pemmican
and ate his morning meal. Presently
Raven Wing awoke and seeing that Hawk
Eye was about ready to launch the canoes, he
hurried down to the river to bathe. He would
have launched his own craft had not the elder
boy wisely counseled him to first make a
hearty meal. Before long they were both
out on the river.</p>

<p>On coming to the rapids, Hawk Eye
grounded his craft on a narrow strip of sand
and unloaded. As soon as Raven Wing had
placed his packs upon the sand, Hawk Eye
said;</p>

<p>"You and I will shoulder my canoe and
carry it beyond the rapids."</p>

<p>Waist-high in the tumbling waters they
bore it to quiet water and laid it on the shore.
When Raven Wing's canoe had been safely
transported, they returned for the packs.
One by one these were carried through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
rapids without mishap. The canoes were
then pushed into the water and reloaded.
Once more the boys took their seats and paddled
down stream.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE BEAVER DAM</h3>


<p>During the next few days the boys
made good progress. They passed the
Yellow Medicine, Sparrowhawk and Redwood
rivers. On the fourth day when but a
few miles above the mouth of the Cottonwood,
Raven Wing said: "Let us go ashore.
It is time we ate."</p>

<p>So they beached the canoes on a sandy
shore. Hawk Eye took out pemmican and
dried bear meat from a pack and sat down
beside Raven Wing. When their hunger
was satisfied, Hawk Eye said:</p>

<p>"I think there may be beavers upstream,"
pointing to a rivulet that emptied into the
Minnesota a short distance from them. "If
so, and there are many, we can come here
later on and get pelts. Shall we see?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"By all means," agreed Raven Wing.
"Let us go at once."</p>

<p>Picking up their bows and arrows, they
started off. Following the winding course of
the stream for a considerable distance they
came to a dam which held back the water and
formed a fair-sized lake.</p>

<p>At once the boys knew that it had been
built by beavers. The Musquash, sometimes
called the muskrat, although it ought to be
called the muskbeaver, because it is really a
beaver and no rat at all, never builds dams
nor digs canals. It has a flat tail like the
beaver and not at all resembling the tapering
tail of water rat. It builds houses, much like
the beaver's, only smaller.</p>

<p>"We will not forget this spot," chuckled
Raven Wing. "We will get many pelts on our
next visit."</p>

<p>"No one shall learn of its location," added
Hawk Eye. "We will get the pelts for ourselves."</p>

<p>"The dam is in fine condition," said Raven
Wing, who had climbed up upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a beaver was to be seen, however.
The wary animals had dived out of sight at
hearing the boys approach.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus066.png" alt="" width="537" height="591" /><br />
    <span class="caption">THE WARY ANIMALS HAD DIVED OUT OF SIGHT AT HEARING THE BOYS APPROACH.</span>
</div>

<p>"Fearless Bear once told me," remarked
Raven Wing, "that hunters rarely see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
beavers building a dam. He says that they
build at night and that it is no easy matter for
a hunter to watch them."</p>

<p>"The musquash is easier to hunt," said
Hawk Eye. "But he is less than half the size
of the beaver; besides, his pelt is not so valuable."</p>

<p>"I've seen a beaver caught that weighed
almost eighty pounds," said Raven Wing.
"It had beautiful fur and a tail as big as a
musquash."</p>

<p>"No fur on its tail," laughed Hawk Eye.
"It's covered with rough scales. Beaver uses
it to scull its way through the water."</p>

<p>"I wish the dam were larger," said Raven
Wing. "Big dam, many beavers."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of beavers here," said
Hawk Eye. "Enough for you and me unless
some hunter comes across it before another
snow."</p>

<p>As Raven Wing stepped off the dam and
walked upstream along the bank, he said;
"Fearless Bear told the hunters one night
when I was in his lodge, that he had seen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
beaver dam near a great body of water that
measured two hundred and sixty feet long
and six feet high."</p>

<p>"Might not have been so many beavers at
work on it," said Hawk Eye. "Probably it
took a long time to build it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus068.png" alt="Beaver." width="300" height="155" />
</div>

<p>As the boys strolled along they noted the
number of stumps which were all that remained
of the trees which the beavers had
cut down and divided into short lengths, such
as could be carried by mouth when building
the dam.</p>

<p>"Sharp teeth to cut these trees," remarked
Raven Wing. "Some of these
stumps are two feet thick."</p>

<p>"Did Fearless Bear tell you how the beaver
works?" asked Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"He supports himself by his tail when he
rears on his hind legs to cut down a tree,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
answered Raven Wing. "With his teeth he
cuts the wood as neatly as a hunter cuts it
with his hatchet. No nibbling like a mouse,"
went on Raven Wing, "he makes a neat job,
and can even make the tree fall in the direction
he wishes."</p>

<p>"What else did Fearless Bear say?" asked
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"When the beaver has cut the tree into
short lengths he drags the cuttings to the
place where he is to build the dam. He brings
the branches, too, in his mouth and rolls
stones along the shore to pile on them and
hold them in place. At first the dam is rough
and loose, but the beavers keep constantly at
work, smoothing and pressing it down and
stopping all the gaps with clay and pebbles
from the bank. As time goes on it becomes
overgrown with grass and bushes and looks
as if it were a natural bank, just like this
one," said Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"After a freshet, beaver must make repairs,"
remarked Hawk Eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus070.png" alt="Brave with headdress." width="304" height="400" />
</div>

<p>"Fearless Bear told me he once made
holes in a dam and during the night watched
the beavers patch up the damaged places,"
laughed Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to be a beaver," said
Hawk Eye. "It must be tiresome to live under
the ice roof of a pond. I've noticed how
the beavers sport and play when the ice
breaks up."</p>

<p>Raven Wing turned on his heel and
pointed to a beaver lodge. It stood not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
from the bank, its roof above the water line.
Both boys were well aware that the beaver
builds the doorway to his lodge well below the
freezing line. As they both stood looking at
the deserted lodge, Raven Wing said; "Beaver
often has two openings down deep in the
water. Through these hidden entrances he
drags branches and pieces of bark up to his
dining room, which being above the water
line, is dry and comfortable."</p>

<p>"Come," said Hawk Eye. "Let us go back
to our canoes now. We have seen enough
for today."</p>

<p>As they strode toward the Minnesota
River, Raven Wing said; "I shall trade some
of my pelts for steel traps. With these we
can catch the beaver more easily than by
spears."</p>

<p>"I will, too," said Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"We will not have to bait the traps," went
on Raven Wing. "Fearless Bear tells me to
merely rub them with some odor or essence
of which the animals are fond."</p>

<p>"That will be easy," grinned Hawk Eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently they rounded a bend in the little
stream and came to the spot where they had
beached their canoes. To their dismay they
found that they had disappeared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>TOEPRINTS IN THE SAND</h3>


<p>For a moment the boys stood silent and
uncertain. Hawk Eye was the first to
speak. "Follow me," he cried, and ran down
the bank of the little stream. He soon came
to a sandy point where its waters mingled
with those of the Minnesota.</p>

<p>"Look," he said. "One of our heavy
loaded canoes went aground here," and he
pointed to deep marks in the sand. "And
here are the toeprints of the thief who
pushed them off."</p>

<p>"He has gone downstream with them,"
said Raven Wing. "His canoe was probably
caught in the swift current as it rounded the
point and was carried downstream before he
could tow the canoes into the big river, and
his towline tightened across the point and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
grounded our first canoe here. Then he
came back and pushed it off and around the
point."</p>

<p>"We must follow," said Hawk Eye. Keeping
as close to the river as was possible, the
boys set off at an easy lope. Presently they
were forced to change their course, for the
willows, cottonwoods, elms and soft maples
that lined the banks made progress slow and
difficult.</p>

<p>Leaving the narrow valley through which
the river made continuous twists and turns,
they hurried up the slope and soon found
themselves on the treeless prairie, which
stretched far away to the sky. As far as eye
could reach not a tree could be seen. Except
for great boulders of granite and limestone
which dotted it here and there, the plain was
covered with grass.</p>

<p>As they turned to follow a course parallel
with that of the river, Raven Wing thoughtfully
remarked:</p>

<p>"We are not sure that our canoes are being
taken downstream."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"The thief," answered Hawk Eye, "would
have to pass many Sioux villages on the
banks of the river if he did otherwise. He
will take the pelts to the trading post at Mendota."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right," answered Raven
Wing. "Why should he tow our heavy laden
canoes upstream? And how would he account
for their possession should he meet
with any of our own people? We are two
birds with broken wings. Paddles and current
will carry the canoes faster than we can
hope to run for any length of time."</p>

<p>"But we must get back our canoes," answered
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Raven Wing made no answer. He slowly
loosened the leather thong about his neck and
opened a small doeskin bag that hung by a
leather thong about his neck. Squatting
down he took out the wing of a crow.</p>

<p>"I will make medicine," he said. After
some little time he replaced the crow's wing
in the doeskin bag and fastened the leather
thong about his neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Great Mystery bids me remember
how the river runs," he said.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus076.png" alt="" width="447" height="600" /><br />
    <span class="caption">"THE GREAT MYSTERY BIDS ME REMEMBER HOW THE RIVER RUNS," HE SAID.</span>
</div>

<p>"And how does it run?" asked Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Tightening its string until the bow was
shaped like a half moon, Raven Wing laid it
upon the ground. Placing an arrow, pointed
outward, at the center of the curved ash
wood, he said, "This arrow points to the Ever
Summer Land."</p>

<p>Setting another arrow, with feathered
end against the bowstring at a point half
way between the tips, he dropped a pebble
beside it and said; "This arrow points to the
Land of Snows."</p>

<p>When a third arrow, pointed outward,
with two pebbles beside it, had been placed
at one tip of the bow, he said;</p>

<p>"Thither lies the Land of the Rising Sun."</p>

<p>The fourth and last arrow he laid with
stone head pointing outward, at the other tip
of the bow. Then, having placed three pebbles
beside it, he said;</p>

<p>"Thither lies the Land of the Setting Sun."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Great Mystery is kind," remarked
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"He has bid me remember my stepfather's
description of the Minnesota's
course," answered Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"And now what do you propose to do?"
asked Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"We will make a trail across the prairie
towards the rising sun straight as the flight
of an arrow. <ins class="correction" title="Original: &quot;Come">Come</ins>; let us start," answered
Raven Wing.</p>

<p>At once both boys set off at an easy lope.
Ohitika bounded ahead, flushing a flock of
ground sparrows which chattered loudly at
the interruption to their grassy nest building.
But to the clamor of their voices and
whirring wings the dog failed to see a badger
which was burrowing in the sod.</p>

<p>As the boys pressed on, larks and blue
birds filled the air with song; prairie wolves
skulked away to grove and swale, and rattlesnakes
glided over moist places to rocky
shelter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>High up in the sky a sand-hill crane,
northward bound in lonely flight, sounded a
far off call.</p>

<p>"'Tis a good omen," cried Hawk Eye.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>ACROSS THE PRAIRIE</h3>


<p>As the sun rode slowly down the sky
and passed the barriers of the low-hanging
clouds, a herd of tiny prong-horned
antelopes scampered near for a closer view
of the boys and dog.</p>

<p>"Down, Ohitika!" Hawk Eye commanded.
"We need fresh meat," he added, turning to
Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"But they are beyond arrow flight," answered
the younger boy.</p>

<p>"They are inquisitive animals," said
Hawk Eye. "I will try to bring them nearer.
<ins class="correction" title="Original: &quot;Let">Let</ins> us lie down and see if I cannot attract
their attention."</p>

<p>Both boys dropped to the ground. Hawk
Eye fastened a moccasin to one end of his
bow and slowly waved it to and fro. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
few minutes an antelope came slowly toward
them. Pausing now and again, it
gradually came within range. In the meantime
Raven Wing had set the head of an
arrow against the string. At length he let
it fly. The stricken animal gave a leap into
the air and fell to the ground. Its frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
comrades galloped away and were out of
range before Raven Wing could send out
another arrow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus081.png" alt="" width="600" height="552" /><br />
    <span class="caption">HAWK EYE FASTENED A MOCCASIN TO ONE END OF HIS BOW AND SLOWLY WAVED IT TO AND FRO.</span>
</div>

<p>The sun was now near its setting, so the
boys decided to make camp close to a great
boulder. From a clump of low bushes Raven
Wing gathered enough dry twigs and leaves
to make a small fire, and before long strips
of antelope meat were roasting over the
flames. The bushes grew around a tiny
spring, at which they drank and satisfied
their thirst before they sat down to eat.</p>

<p>When the meal was ended, Hawk Eye
said: "Let us cut up the choice parts of the
antelope into thin strips. These can be hung
from a strip of hide and allowed to dry in the
sun as we journey on."</p>

<p>For some little time before darkness came
down the boys were busy preparing the meat
for drying.</p>

<p>"We will get up with the sun," said Hawk
Eye, as he stretched himself on the ground.</p>

<p>At the first pale tint of dawn the boys
awoke. After drinking and bathing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
spring they ate heartily of the portion of well
cooked meat that remained from their evening
meal. Taking another long drink at
the spring, they hung their bows from their
shoulders and lifted the leather thong with
the strips of meat from the bush tops.</p>

<p>"The wind and the sun will soon dry the
meat," remarked Hawk Eye, taking hold of
one end. Raven Wing grasped the other and
they set off over the short, light green, hair-like
grass of the upland. Dew glittered on
stem and flower as the sun rose higher. Now
and again the peep of the prairie chick or
the call of the plover came to their ears. As
they neared a rocky ridge a badger slipped
into his den.</p>

<p>At length Raven Wing remarked, "Very
soon we should come across a trail to the
river."</p>

<p>"The trail of the paleface trader Renville?"
inquired Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Yes; 'tis wide and well worn by the
wheels of his carts and the hoofs of his oxen,"
answered Raven <ins class="correction" title="Original: Wing.&quot;">Wing.</ins><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sun reached the middle of the sky,
Hawk Eye stopped. Dropping his end of the
leather thong, he said;</p>

<p>"We have not yet found the trail. Let
us spread apart. I will follow a line running
between the land of Snows and the Rising
Sun. You go forward slantingly toward the
Ever Summer Land. But neither of us may
go far without again setting face toward the
Rising Sun. By so doing, one of us may come
upon the trail as we journey toward the upward
bend of the river."</p>

<p>"We must keep within the sound of each
other's voice," cautioned Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Hawk Eye. "I will shoulder
the meat. It is by now quite dry." Making
a bundle of the strips, he set off at a
slant towards the north. Raven Wing
veered towards the south.</p>

<p>Before long he halted at a faint, distant
call from Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"He has come across the trail," said Raven
Wing to himself. Turning toward the
north, he broke into a run. As he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the ridge of a low swell of ground, he saw
Hawk Eye. In a few minutes he stood beside
him.</p>

<p>"You have found the trail," he laughed,
perceiving the sunken track made by cart
wheels.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we must go fast to catch the
thief," answered Hawk Eye. "We must gain
a point of vantage on the bank ahead of him.
Once there, we can lay plans to recover our
stolen canoes."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS ARE TAKEN PRISONERS</h3>


<p>The sun set and it set again. Raven
Wing and Hawk Eye pushed on across
the prairie toward the Minnesota River.
They had left the trail and were veering toward
the north.</p>

<p>"It would not be wise to make the great
ford called by the white men Sioux," Hawk
Eye had said. "We must come at a fair distance
from there down the river to a point
where the banks are high and the timber
heavy."</p>

<p>"We will continue to journey through the
night until the river is in sight," answered
Raven Wing.</p>

<p>Hawk Eye grunted in assent. Once only
did they pause for water at a spring in the
midst of a clump of cottonwood trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sun rose they neared the river and
soon after they were camping not far from a
bluff, eating their breakfast beside a small
fire, which sent so thin a column of smoke
into the air that it was almost dissipated before
it reached the treetops.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Raven Wing
said:</p>

<p>"I will take Ohitika and keep watch over
the river while you get some sleep." Armed
with his bow and arrows, he strode off toward
the brow of the bluff.</p>

<p>Hawk Eye loaded his gun and placed it
against a tree, together with powder horn
and bullet pouch. Then, throwing himself
at full length on the green moss beneath the
tree, he fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Scarcely a quarter of an hour had passed
when he was startled by the report of a gun,
which was followed by a war cry from Raven
Wing and a series of war whoops. At the
same instant, and before he could attempt to
rise, his legs and arms were pinioned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ground by two Indians. For a minute Hawk
Eye was paralyzed. Then the terrible reality
of his position, the cry of warning from Raven
Wing, and the sight of the thong with
which his captors were about to bind him,
brought him to his senses. With a display
of strength that surprised his captors, he
hurled them right and left. As one of them
struggled to his feet, he received a blow from
Hawk Eye's tomahawk that felled him; the
other, fearing for his life, dodged behind a
tree.</p>

<p>As Hawk Eye glanced quickly around in
search of his gun which no longer rested
against the tree, he saw Raven Wing between
the tree trunks being hurried away
by two other Indians. As the arrow leaps
from the bow Hawk Eye sprang forward in
pursuit. The Indians saw him coming, but
having dropped their guns in the scuffle with
Raven Wing, they were unable to fire at
Hawk Eye as he approached. At this point
the Indian who had hidden behind the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
threw a heavy stick which struck Hawk Eye
on the back of the head with such force that
he fell, bleeding and insensible, upon the
ground.</p>

    <span class="caption">AS THE ARROW LEAPS FROM THE BOW HAWK EYE SPRANG FORWARD IN PURSUIT.</span>
</div>

<p>When Hawk Eye recovered from the
effects of the blow, he found himself lying
on the cold earth in total darkness, and firmly
bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>In vain he tried to break the leather
thongs. He called loudly for Raven Wing,
hoping his friend had somehow escaped and
would come to his aid. But only echoes of
his own voice answered him. The dreadful
thought now flashed across his mind that the
enemy had buried him alive in some dark
cave. At length the gray dawn shone in upon
him and showed that he was in a deep hollow
in the bluff overhanging the river.</p>

<p>Again he called to Raven Wing. Scarcely
had the echoes of his voice died away, when
a man's figure darkened the mouth of the
cave.</p>

<p>"Raven Wing!" cried Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Slow Dog has heard your call," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
a sneering voice. Bending over the helpless
boy the Medicine Man drew a scalping knife
from his belt and cut the thong that bound
his feet and hands, and signed for him to rise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus091.png" alt="" width="600" height="362" /><br />
    <span class="caption">"SLOW DOG HAS HEARD YOUR CALL," ANSWERED A SNEERING VOICE.</span>
</div>

<p>With difficulty Hawk Eye stood upon his
legs, numbed by long binding. He said
nothing, however, observing that the sneer
still played about Slow Dog's lips.</p>

<p>"Come," commanded the Medicine Man.
Hawk Eye obeyed and followed him to the
timber belt where the struggle of the previous
night had taken place. Presently they
came to an Indian camp. There were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
tepees, but the several blankets that lay under
the trees indicated where the party had
lain during the night. A Chippeway Indian
squatted beside a fire, holding Hawk Eye's
dog by a leash.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>HAWK EYE'S REVENGE</h3>


<p>From the fact that the camp was without
tepees or squaws, and the Chippeway's
face was daubed with red paint, Hawk
Eye knew that he had fallen in with a small
party on the warpath, but he could not account
for the Medicine Man's presence with
the Sioux's hereditary enemy. As he
thought over the matter Slow Dog's detaining
hand gripped his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Son of Running Deer," said the Medicine
Man, "I have no cause to quarrel with you.
But between Black Eagle and me there is
much bad blood. You shall return to your
village. It is mine no longer. Say to Old
Smoky Wolf that I have become a Chippeway;
that I and my Chippeway brothers will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
soon pay a visit to his village to take scalps.
Say to Black Eagle that I shall hold his stepson
a captive."</p>

<p>As he finished, Ohitika gave a sudden
spring, whipping the leash from the hand
of the Indian beside the fire. Leaping across
the ground, he sprang at Slow Dog's throat.
As the Medicine Man raised his foot and
kicked the animal, Hawk Eye dealt him a
blow between the eyes and darted off, followed
by the faithful dog.</p>

<p>On coming to a tree against which were
propped two guns, with powder horns and
bullet pouches, he slowed down to pick them
up, then dashed ahead. At a distance of
fifty feet or more he saw Raven Wing, bound
to a tree. One of the guns he had captured
carried a ramrod sharpened at one end, and
on coming up to Raven Wing, he began to
sever the thongs that bound him with the
sharpened point. Before he could finish,
however, Slow Dog, who had followed,
sprang upon him. Staggering forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Hawk Eye fell to the ground, carrying the
Medicine Man with him.</p>

<p>As Slow Dog attempted to rise, Hawk
Eye raised his foot and struck him so heavily
upon the stomach that he fell with a groan
and lay writhing upon the ground. In the
meantime, the Chippeway had come up and
springing like an infuriated tiger toward
Raven Wing, drove a knife at the boy's
throat.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Raven Wing's arms were
tied in front of him, so that by raising them
he was enabled to ward off the blow. The
knife fortunately merely scratched the fleshy
part of his left arm, but in doing so severed
the thong that bound them. With a mighty
wrench Raven Wing burst the thong that
Hawk Eye had all but severed, and slipped
around behind the tree. As the Chippeway
again rushed after him, Hawk Eye felled
him with the butt of his gun.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" shouted Hawk Eye, and
bounded toward the cave in the bluff, which
was not more than fifty yards distant. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
couple of arrows from the bows of two Chippeway
Indians who were returning to camp
from an early hunting trip followed him.
The suddenness of his flight, however, had
rendered their hasty aim uncertain, and in
another moment he was around and behind
the sheltering cliff. With wild yells the Indians
darted forward in pursuit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus096.png" alt="" width="600" height="355" /><br />
    <span class="caption">A COUPLE OF ARROWS ... FOLLOWED HIM.</span>
</div>

<p>About thirty paces beyond the point of
the cliff that hid him for a few moments from
view, was the cave in which he had spent
the night. Quick as thought he sprang up
the steep trail to its entrance and darted in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Crouching behind a ledge of rock close to
the entrance, he waited for the two Indians
to appear. Presently he saw one of them
peering around the bend in the cliff wall.
Raising his gun to his shoulder, he fired. The
Indian's face disappeared from sight, but
whether the bullet had hit the mark, Hawk
Eye could not determine.</p>

<p>In the meantime Raven Wing, not daring
to run into range of the arrows from the
two Indians, had darted into the bushes and
made for the rocky ground in the rear of the
camp. In doing so he happened to pass the
tree against which Slow Dog had rested
Hawk Eye's gun, with shot-belt and powder
horn. Picking them up, he climbed over the
rocks and up to a wooded ridge that overlooked
the cave in which Hawk Eye had
sought shelter.</p>

<p>From this high point Raven Wing noticed
that the bed of dried up water course led
through the bushes towards the cave. Without
further delay he hurried down to it, and
sped swiftly along between its high bush-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>bordered
banks. But, on drawing near to
the cave, he was disappointed to find an open
space, without tree or shrub, between it and
the edge of the bushes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>TWO GOOD SHOTS</h3>


<p>Peering cautiously out between the
heavy undergrowth, Raven Wing saw
the two Indians, who had pursued Hawk Eye,
crouching behind a boulder on the opposite
side of the open space. He realized that it
would be impossible for him to cross the open
ground without being hit by an arrow, and
he also felt reasonably certain that as soon
as they were joined by Slow Dog, they would
set off to find him, leaving the Medicine Man
to prevent Hawk Eye's escape from the cave.</p>

<p>While debating as to what might be the
best thing to do, he looked towards the cave
and to his surprise saw Hawk Eye signing
to him from behind a ledge of rock that
screened him completely from the view of
the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Answering the sign to assure his friend
that he had seen him, Raven Wing made a
series of signs which were finally understood
by Hawk Eye to mean that he was to come
out and expose himself to the view of the
Indians.</p>

<p>Stepping out of the cave, he uttered a
piercing war whoop and darted back. Slow
Dog and his comrades answered with a volley
of arrows. This was just what Raven Wing
had expected, and before they could again
fit arrows to their bows, he dashed across
the open space and slipped into the cave, followed
by Ohitika.</p>

<p>Angered at being outwitted by a boy,
Slow Dog and the Chippeways rushed forward
across the open space, but before they
had covered half its distance, a bullet from
Hawk Eye's gun brought one of the Chippeways
tumbling to earth. Without waiting to
pick him up, Slow Dog and his comrade
sought the shelter of the bushes, where they
lay concealed. From the mouth of the cave
the boys could see four canoes drawn up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the beach. As Hawk Eye reloaded his gun,
Raven Wing caught sight of an Indian stealing
down towards the canoes. Lifting the
gun to his shoulder, Raven Wing fired and
the Chippeway fell face downward on the
sand.</p>

<p>"Good!" grunted Hawk Eye. "The odds
are now with us. However, Slow Dog's
craftiness more than equals ours. If he sees
he cannot get us, he will try to make off with
our canoes."</p>

<p>"But if he ventures on the beach, he
knows he will be shot," remarked Raven
Wing.</p>

<p>"He will wait for darkness," said Hawk
Eye.</p>

<p>"Darkness protects the rabbit as well as
the fox," cried Raven Wing. As he finished,
a low exclamation burst from Hawk Eye's
lips. "Look!" he said. "Someone is stealing
through the bushes!"</p>

<p>"The bodies of the two braves still lie upon
the ground," said Raven Wing. "Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the brave we left for dead in the camp has recovered."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus102.png" alt="Brave behind fallen tree." width="600" height="326" />
</div>

<p>For some time the boys kept their gaze
directed toward the canoes, but no second
brave dared to venture toward them, although
they lay only a few yards distant
from the edge of the timber. Slow Dog and
his companion were held at bay by the watchful
eyes of the two boys. A bullet would be
their answer to any attempt to reach the
canoes.</p>

<p>The canoes now became the chief object
of interest to all concerned. Slow Dog realized
that if the boys should succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
reaching the canoes they could escape. This,
of course, they could not hope to do as long
as daylight lasted nor even when night
should arrive, unless it were a very dark one,
since he and his comrade were armed with
bow and arrows. On the other hand, he
knew, now that the boys had possession of
the guns, that it would be almost certain
death to venture on the beach so long as there
was sufficient light to enable Hawk Eye to
aim with his gun.</p>

<p>"Let them make the first move," thought
the crafty Medicine Man.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hawk Eye and Raven
Wing were making plans for the coming of
darkness. As the sun's last rays faded away
and the night began to deepen, Hawk Eye
moved close to the entrance of the cave. Adjusting
his gun to his satisfaction, he marked
its position exactly on the rock so that, when
the canoes should be entirely hidden from
sight, he could make reasonably certain of
hitting any object directly in front of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
And in order to show Slow Dog that he and
Raven Wing were still on the alert, he shortly
aimed at the canoes, which were now invisible,
and fired.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>OHITIKA IS WOUNDED</h3>


<p>Almost instantaneously a death cry
rent the air, proving that the bullet
had hit either Slow Dog or his companion.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted Hawk Eye. "Slow Dog's
trick has failed him. The odds are two to
one in our favor." Hardly had he finished
speaking when an arrow struck the ledge of
rocks behind which they were crouching.</p>

<p>"Slow Dog is no mean marksman," said
Raven Wing. "We must not be careless."</p>

<p>As Hawk Eye <ins class="correction" title="Original: re-loaded">reloaded</ins> his gun, he noticed,
in spite of the gathering gloom, blood
stains upon the stock. For several moments
he regarded them in silence. Then turned
to Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"I think I have a plan that will work well,"
he said. "Come here, Ohitika," he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
squatting down on the floor of the cave. The
faithful dog came fawning to his feet.</p>

<p>"Smell, smell!" he commanded, placing
the blood stained gunstock close to the dog's
nose.</p>

<p>Ohitika answered with a growl. It was
enemy smell to him. He had not forgotten
that Slow Dog had kicked him.</p>

<p>"Take your gun and hold the dog by the
collar," said Hawk Eye to Raven Wing.
Again resting his gun on the ledge of rock,
he fired. Before the echoes of the report had
died away, a second arrow entered the cave's
mouth and struck the rock wall in the rear.</p>

<p>"Come, follow me, before Slow Dog finds
time to fit another arrow to his bow," said
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Raven Wing obeyed. When out of the
cave, and to one side of the opening, Hawk
Eye seized Raven Wing's loaded gun and
gave him his. "Load it," he said in a low
voice, grasping the leather thong about
Ohitika's neck to give Raven Wing the free
use of both hands. Then, like three shadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the two boys and the dog, glided into the
dense darkness. Almost immediately Hawk
Eye released his hold upon the dog and whispered,
"Go get him! Go get him!"</p>

<p>As Ohitika darted off in the murky darkness,
Raven Wing all but tripped over the
body of the Chippeway he had killed. Forgetting
the urgent need to reach the canoes,
he felt with his hand for the Chippeway's
scalp lock. Grasping it tightly in his left
hand, he deftly circled it at its base with his
knife and tore it away.</p>

<p>"You are now a warrior," whispered
Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>Groping their way toward the beach, they
made as much speed as safety would permit.
Hawk Eye's course proved straight and true
and in a few minutes they heard the river
water lapping at the sand. Suddenly, from a
distance, came a series of yaps and barks.
Confident that Ohitika aided by the darkness
would be above to hold Slow Dog at bay for a
reasonable length of time, Hawk Eye whispered,
"I must find the body of the Chip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>peway
I killed!" Hardly were the words out
of his mouth when he came upon it stretched
over the bow of one of the canoes.</p>

<p>As he bent over to obtain the highly prized
scalp, Raven Wing noiselessly launched the
two enemy canoes and gave them a push to
set them in the current. The paddles, which
he had removed before launching, he laid in
his own canoe, but as he was about to set it
afloat, Hawk Eye said;</p>

<p>"We can't leave the dog."</p>

<p>"It is the only way out," answered Raven
Wing. "Come, push off your canoe."</p>

<p>"No," said Hawk Eye. "I will not leave
Ohitika."</p>

<p>For a moment Raven Wing paused.
Then, seizing hold of Hawk Eye's canoe, he
dragged it off the beach. As the yelps and
barks drew nearer, he climbed into his.
Hawk Eye, stepping slowly into his craft, sat
down and raised his gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>Suddenly the barking changed to a yell
of pain.</p>

<p>"Ohitika has been hit by an arrow," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Hawk Eye, and he fired his gun into the air.</p>

<p>"'Twill warn Slow Dog to halt and also
enable Ohitika to lay a straight course to us,"
went on Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>As the canoes began to drift away from
shore, the sound of a sudden splash caused
Hawk Eye to exclaim in a low voice, "Ohitika
is swimming toward us."</p>

<p>Laying down his gun, he picked up his
paddle and noiselessly dipped it in the water
to check the canoe's progress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE TRADING POST</h3>


<p>There being neither moon nor stars,
Hawk Eye could no longer make out the
shore line, but as he softly dipped his paddle,
his ears caught the sound of a faint wheeze
close at hand, followed by a muffled bark.
Dropping the paddle, he leaned over the side
of the canoe and lifted in his faithful dog.
As he laid the animal down, the feathered
end of an arrow brushed his cheek. Gently
feeling with his fingers, he found that the
barb had only slantingly penetrated the
fleshy part of the dog's thigh. A short, deft
stroke of his knife made it easy to pull out
the arrow. Picking up his paddle, he turned
the canoe midstream, and after a few strokes
came alongside Raven Wing who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
holding his canoe from floating away with
the current.</p>

<p>"Come in with me," said Hawk Eye in a
low voice. "We must keep together or we
may become separated in the darkness."</p>

<p>Raven Wing climbed into Hawk Eye's
canoe and held on to his own while Hawk Eye
bent to his paddle. In a short time they were
far down stream.</p>

<p>At early dawn they came across the two
Chippeway canoes. Fastening to each a long
strip of buffalo hide, they easily towed them
down the river.</p>

<p>It was pleasant paddling as the beautiful
Minnesota twisted and turned in its broad
and sunny valley. Cottonwood and willow
bordered its banks, which rolled back in gentle
slopes of pale green, dotted with tree
clumps, to the broad prairie. Blooming wild
rose vines crept close to the water which
sparkled in the sunshine or reflected the tints
of the sky.</p>

<p>At its mouth, where it emptied into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Mississippi, the Minnesota spread out around
a great flat island.</p>

<p>"We will not beach our canoes here," said
Hawk Eye. "Fearless Bear advised me to see
the trader on that little island yonder. He is
known to deal justly with the red men. The
Sioux call him Walking Wind."</p>

<p>Running their own canoes gently up on
the sandy beach, they pulled the empty Chippeway
canoes a little further up on shore and
looked about them.</p>

<p>"Come, we will go to the post," said Hawk
Eye, pointing to a building made of native
limestone, with shutters and doorways of
wood painted white.</p>

<p>As the boys drew near, they noticed
groups of Indians with their squaws and Canadian
boatmen with pipes in their mouths,
gathered in front of a great wing, which on
entering they found to be the company store.
Blankets, traps, sleigh bells, scarlet cloth,
beads, silk handkerchiefs and earbobs lay
spread upon long counters. On others, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ready
sorted and packed for shipment, lay
pelts of muskrat, fox, wolf, beaver and mink,
together with skins of deer and hides of
buffalo.</p>

<p>"You need not look for a gun," said Hawk
Eye in a low voice, noticing that Raven Wing
paid little attention to the display on the
counters. "You already have Slow Dog's
gun; it is a fine one. But you are in need of
powder and bullets, as I am."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, a white man of
about thirty, tall and muscular, came forward
and asked them in the Sioux language
what they wanted.</p>

<p>Both boys held up their guns and answered
that they wished ammunition for
their weapons.</p>

<p>"What have you in exchange?" asked the
trader.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/illus114.png" alt="" width="445" height="600" /><br />
    <span class="caption">"WHAT HAVE YOU IN EXCHANGE?" ASKED THE TRADER.</span>
</div>

<p>"We have pelts; they are in our canoes
on the beach," said Hawk Eye.</p>

<p>"Bring them here and we will trade,"
smiled the trader.</p>

<p>As the boys turned to go back to the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a><br /><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the trader asked; "How came you by the
fresh scalps at your belts?"</p>

<p>"We killed two thieving Chippeways," answered
Hawk Eye. Here he paused, thinking
it best not to mention Slow Dog, for he
was a Sioux and the tribe must not be humiliated
by the telling of his treachery. "We
took their canoes. Will you trade also for
canoes?" Hawk Eye continued after a brief
silence.</p>

<p>"I will go with you and look at them,"
answered the trader. Beckoning to three Indians,
he accompanied the boys to the river.</p>

<p>"My Indian brothers will help you carry
the pelts," he explained as they went along.</p>

<p>On arriving at the shore, the trader's eyes
glittered as he looked at the beautifully built
Chippeway canoes. "I will take them in
trade," he said.</p>

<p>"We would rather part with our own
canoes," answered Hawk Eye. "We would
be proud to return to our village in our
enemy's canoes and with their scalps at our
belt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The trader smiled at the boy's words. "In
that case I will be content to take the Sioux-built
craft," he said. "The Sioux excels the
Chippeway in horsemanship, but does not
equal them in canoe building."</p>

<p>In the meantime the three Indians had
shouldered most of the cargo. When Hawk
Eye and Raven Wing had shouldered the
balance, they all set off for the post.</p>

<p>The trader had shown much generosity,
agreed the boys as later on they loaded their
purchases in the Chippeway canoes. How
delighted would be Light Between Clouds
with the scarlet cloth, thought Hawk Eye.
Bending Willow will appear even more beautiful
with the necklace of bright beads at her
throat, thought Raven Wing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>JOURNEY'S END</h3>


<p>Early the following morning Hawk Eye
and Raven Wing pushed off from the
landing and followed up the twisting course
of the river. Paddling was not so easy
against the current.</p>

<p>"We have no need to hurry," remarked
Hawk Eye. "We will visit on our way," and
so they stopped to beach their canoes whenever
they saw upon the bluffs the summer
houses of poles and leaves which the Sioux
erect in place of the winter tepees of dressed
buffalo skin.</p>

<p>Black Dog gave them a hearty welcome.
For several weeks they enjoyed his hospitality.
Further up the river they disembarked
at Penichon's village, where an old
warrior who had once gone on the warpath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
with Smoky Wolf, made much of them on
learning that they were from the band of his
old friend.</p>

<p>"Say to Smoky Wolf," he commanded, as
Hawk Eye and Raven Wing took leave of the
aged brave, "that I predict you will be great
warriors."</p>

<p>Again they beached their canoes on coming
to Shakepay's village, the largest of all.
And so it went all the way up the sky-tinted
water of the curving, twisting river. At Lac
Qui Parle, their last stopping place, they
visited the village of the Wahpeton Sioux,
called the people of the leaves.</p>

<p>Here it was that Raven Wing was reminded
of the time, many, many years before,
when his grandfather made his first
offering to the Great Mystery.</p>

<p>"Red Feather was a great warrior," said
an old squaw. "I remember when he was
very young that Uncheeda, his grandmother,
led him to the top of a high rock from which
to fling his most beloved possession into the
lake."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a necklace of bear claws, was it
not?" asked Raven Wing.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son it was," answered the old
squaw.</p>

<p>At length the two boys took leave of the
friendly Wahpetons. Indian Summer had
come and gone as they rounded the last bend
in the river and saw thin smoke rising from
their village fires.</p>

<p>Ohitika sensed the nearness of old familiar
places and began to bark. The boys bent
to their paddles, sending their frail craft
along at a faster pace.</p>

<p>The sunshine hung like yellow smoke over
Big Stone Lake. Bright-colored leaves,
loosed by the wind, scurried along the
ground. Only the burr oaks held valiantly
to their raiment. A thin crust of ice lay on
the quiet waters of slough and marshland,
but at warm noon, they again reflected the
sky tints of an autumn day. Wild geese
honked overhead and wild ducks winged upward
from the watery wild rice fields.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>On a rise of ground overlooking the river
stood two squaws.</p>

<p>"Six moons have waned since our boys
left for the trading post," said Light Between
Clouds.</p>

<p>"You have counted each moon as I have,"
sighed Bending Willow. "And since the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Slow Dog disappeared so strangely from our
village, my heart has been filled with dread.
He has been no friend to me."</p>

<p>"He is jealous of Black Eagle," added
Light Between Clouds.</p>

<p>As she finished speaking, Bending Willow
started to run down to the river's edge. "I
see two canoes rounding the bend," she called
back. Light Between Clouds ran swiftly

<p>Black Eagle, just returning with a young
deer which he had killed upon his back, let it
fall upon the ground on seeing Bending Willow
running toward the river. He, too, had
been worried over the long absence of his
stepson. As he passed Smoky Wolf's tepee,
the aged chief, who was smoking beside it,
looked up.</p>

<p>"I think Raven Wing and Hawk Eye are
coming up the river," cried Black Eagle as he
ran on.</p>

<p>Old Smoky Wolf slowly rose to his feet.
"I, too, must welcome the young braves," he
murmured. In a short time all the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
women and children were standing upon the
bank to await the boys' arrival.</p>

<p>As the canoes grated upon the sandy
beach, Old Smoky Wolf raised his right arm
and shouted, "They come in Chippeway canoes
with scalps at their belts. My village
has two more warriors to send upon the warpath."</p>
